# Introduction

**AMMSoCK** is an abbreviation for **A** **M**anifold Based **M**odel Reduction **So**ftware
for **C**hemical **K**inetics. The software implements the TBOA in order
to numerically approximate slow invariant manifolds which can be used
to reduce chemical kinetics by utilizing the species reconstruction method
