AMMSoCK - A Manifold Based Model Reduction Software for Chemical Kinetics

AMMSoCK is an abbreviation for A Manifold Based Model Reduction Software
for Chemical Kinetics. The software implements the TBOA in order
to numerically approximate slow invariant manifolds which can be used
to reduce chemical kinetics by utilizing the species reconstruction method
